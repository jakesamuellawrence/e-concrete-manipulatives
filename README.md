### Installation
- Make sure you have NodeJS installed (we don't use node, but we use its package manager npm)
- Clone the repository and cd into it.
- Run the command ```npm install```
- Run the command ```npm run dev```
- Go to http://localhost:3000/ and the website should be running
- Because we are using Vite, every time you save a change it should automatically update
