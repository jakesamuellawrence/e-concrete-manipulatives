# E-Concrete Manipulatives

## Installation
- Make sure you have NodeJS installed (we don't use node, but we use its package manager npm)
- Clone the repository and cd into it.
- Run the command ```npm install```
- Run the command ```npm run dev```
- Go to http://localhost:3000/ and the website should be running
- Because we are using Vite, every time you save a change it should automatically update

## Aims
**From _It’s all about the base: Using E-Concrete Manipulatives to explore Place Value_**

We are a team of mathematics educators working in teacher preparation at the School of Education. Every year, we teach trainee teachers and try to improve their skills and knowledge in mathematics teaching. One aspect we focus on in our classes is the technology and its integration into mathematics teaching. With the help of technology (apps, software, etc.), we help trainees learn how to teach certain mathematics concepts (e.g., place value in numbers, quadrilaterals in geometry) effectively. For example, we worked with a colleague from Turkey to develop a free online app, https://www.geogebra.org/m/dfyexgeb. However, this is at an elementary level and does not fully serve us. We wonder if we can work with CS students to develop a more professional version of this (or this https://mathsbot.com/manipulatives/blocks) as a project. For example, we need a virtual platform where teachers/pupils can draw or generate a given number of sticks and then group them in bundles of 2-15 (or develop a given number of interlocking cubes and stick them together in groups or groups of groups). We would be happy to work with CS students to build a virtual platform (e.g., a piece of software built into the web or a simple stand-alone app) as part of the Team Project. Once completed, we believe that University of Glasgow students and the wider community can benefit from it.
